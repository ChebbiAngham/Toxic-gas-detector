# Toxic-gas-detector
a toxic gaz detector using STM32F4

The project consists of a unit that involves an MQ32 smoke detector: In fact, once the sensor detects unusual smoke emissions, an alarm (presented by a buzzer in our case) is then activated.
The user is also notified in his phone thanks to the HC-05 bluetooth module with real-time information such as the current temperature in his house (LM-335 sensor).
A ventilation system is then automatically activated to discharge the smoke from the endangered area (step by step) motor is activated
